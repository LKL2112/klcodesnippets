Amazon Transcribe is very new.  Generally available as of April 4, 2018, we may be beholden to a work in progress if we go this route.
With such a new platform, changes are inevitable and that could mean API changes to support fundamental audio processing changes.
		
Amazon Transcribe supports a variety of lossless and lossy formats such as MP3.  Support for MP3 means no changes to our current 
voicemail encoding and slightly less storage requirements compared to FLAC or other lossless audio formats.

As of August 15, 2018, Transcribe only works with English and Spanish

Uses S3 as the storage location for the voicemail audio files to be transcribed.

Considerable configuration needed to allow access to S3 from the Transcribe console.  Typical of Amazon, configuration issues create
development delays.  As long as we have a team dedicated to Amazon configuration, this solution is viable.

Using the Amazon transcribe console, transcribing audio takes roughly 1 minute.  Thankfully, the transcription process is asynchronous.
According to Amazon, they are working to improve the processing speed. 

Documentation on the Amazon Transcribe API is very limited and there are few entries on the Amazon Transcribe forum or other software
development sites.

Amazon Transcribe pricing is as follows:		
		$0.0004 per second.  Usage is billed in 1 second increments with a minimum per request charge of 15 seconds
