Notes on Google Speech-To-Text:

A Google Cloud Platform account is required to use the Speech-To-Text client.  Once an account is established, a key can be downloaded
that allows access to the Google Cloud Platform.  This key could be stored as another Charter property and thus easily accessed by the 
PROD implementation.

Multiple languages can be specified as input.  We are not restricted to English.

The Speech-To-Text client cannot handle MP3 or other lossy audio formats

Automatic language detection isn't very good.  While you can specify a list of languages to consider for translation, the best way to get 
an accurate transcription in the language of the audio is to transcribe the audio using each specified language and check for the one with
the highest confidence rating.  Thus, we need to be careful deciding which languages we intend to use.

Pricing is per month as follows:
		0 - 60 minutes = free
		60 - 1000000 minutes = $0.006 USD / 15 seconds
		per Google:
		This pricing is for applications on personal systems (e.g., phones, tablets, laptops, desktops). Please contact us for approval and pricing 
		to use the Speech-to-Text API on embedded devices (e.g., cars, TVs, appliances, or speakers).
		
		Each request is rounded up to the nearest increment of 15 seconds. For example, if you make three separate requests, each containing 7 
		seconds of audio, you are billed $0.018 USD for 45 seconds (3 Ã— 15 seconds) of audio. Fractions of seconds are included when rounding up 
		to the nearest increment of 15 seconds. That is, 15.14 seconds are rounded up and billed as 30 seconds.
		
		Monthly usage is capped at 1 million minutes per month. For usage above 1 million minutes of audio per month, we would like to understand 
		more about your needs. Please submit a Cloud Speech-to-Text Quota Request for your project.
